when good enough isn't

<!--
  NOTES

  idealism/lack of contentment (satisfaction is the death of desire)

  I find myself questioning existing stuff but lacking the context to know why or what might be better, so I explore.
  It is as much about the experience of the developer as it is about the experience of the user.
  Finding empowerment through code and sharing that empowerment others.
  Make your own tools.

  Take notes when you see weird stuff, its too easy to forget to revisit.

  It is difficult to expand and get better if you accept things as good enough, but hard to get things done if you don't.

  Libraries as expert systems
